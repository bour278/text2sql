    "Levels of basic SQL agents. The goal here is starting with basic prompting + access to SQL/code working. Then add in more CoT before getting a more advanced cognitive architecture. The goal here is essentially if there is a user query that I could have answered in say less than an hour using the resources the LLM was given, it should be able to as well. In other words, the data and query must be coherent, with that being the only real requirement. \n",

Compute the mean and standard deviation of the 'stock_movement' column. Next, filter the dataframe twice, once for stock movements that are more than 1 standard deviation from the mean and once for movements more than 2 standard deviations from the mean. For each filtered dataframe, calculate the spread between 'tsy_yield_7_year' and 'tsy_yield_5_year' by subtracting the latter from the former to create a new column 'yield_spread'. Then, for each of the two cases (s=1 and s=2), use matplotlib's `plt.hist()` function to create a histogram of the 'yield_spread'. Calculate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the 'yield_spread' using `numpy.percentile()` and use `plt.axvline()` to draw vertical lines at each of these percentiles on the respective histograms. Create the plots side by side using `plt.subplots()` with 1 row and 2 columns. The left plot should correspond to the case where s=1 and the right plot where s=2.

The user is interested in the distribution of the difference between 7-year Treasury yield and 5-year Treasury yield on those particular days for two scenarios: when s=1 and when s=2. The user also wants to visualize this using histograms with lines indicating the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.\n",

      "Here is a step-by-step guide to perform the required computations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Calculate the stock price movement by subtracting the 'stock_open' column from the 'stock_close' column. This will give you a new series (let's call it 'stock_movement').\n",

      "2. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of 'stock_movement'.\n",
      "\n",

      "5. In both 'df_s1' and 'df_s2', calculate the difference between 'tsy_yield_7_year' and 'tsy_yield_5_year' for each row. This will give you two new series, one for 'df_s1' and one for 'df_s2' (let's call them 'yield_diff_s1' and 'yield_diff_s2').\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Use matplotlib.pyplot (plt) to create two subplots side by side. For the left plot, use 'yield_diff_s1' to create a histogram. For the right plot, use 'yield_diff_s2' to create a histogram.\n",

      "7. For both histograms, calculate and draw vertical lines for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the 'yield_diff_s1' and 'yield_diff_s2' distributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Label the x-axis as '7yr TSY Yield - 5yr TSY Yield' and the y-axis as 'Frequency'. Also, add titles to each subplot to distinguish between s=1 and s=2 scenarios.\n",
